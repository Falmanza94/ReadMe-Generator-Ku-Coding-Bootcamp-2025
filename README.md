# ReadMe Generator

## Description
This project is a command-line application which is designed to be an easy to use application, where a future developer can come in and alter the default ReadMe to their needed specifications according to their project. Once the user completes the steps within the terminal a new ReadMe file will be generated.

Thirdly, I need to make sure node.js is already installed as an application on my local computer. Fourthly, I need to make sure a package.json file is running properly and then use the command "npm init -y" to install the proper file type. Lastly, run "npm install".
